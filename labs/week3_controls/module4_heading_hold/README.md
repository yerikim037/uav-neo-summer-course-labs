# Week 3 · Module 4 — Heading Hold

Control the drone's compass heading with the IMU instead of the camera. This is the
first controller in the course that closes a loop on an angle, which forces you to
handle wrap-around (359 deg and 1 deg are 2 deg apart, not 358).

## What you'll learn

- Reading attitude (pitch, roll, yaw) from `get_attitude()`
- Proportional control on yaw to hold a heading
- Handling angle wrap-around in the error term

## Key terms

- **Attitude** — the drone's orientation: pitch (nose up/down), roll (tilt left/right), yaw (compass heading).
- **IMU** — the inertial measurement unit, the sensor that reports attitude. It is independent of the camera.
- **Yaw / heading** — the direction the nose points, here in degrees `[0, 360)`.
- **Angle wrap-around** — angles repeat every 360 deg, so a raw subtraction can give a 350 deg "error" when the true shortest turn is 10 deg. Wrapping into `-180..180` picks the short way around.
- **Setpoint** — the heading you want to hold (`TARGET_HEADING`).

## How to run

```bash
drone open_sim                          # launch the sim once
drone sim course/week3_controls/module4_heading_hold/main.py            # all steps, your code
drone sim course/week3_controls/module4_heading_hold/main_solution.py   # reference flight
```

Press **Enter** in the simulator window to start.

## Steps

1. **`step1_read_heading.py`** — read and print the current yaw heading while turning slowly
2. **`step2_hold_heading.py`** — turn to a target heading and hold it (with wrap-around)

## What to expect

Step 1 turns the drone slowly and prints its heading. Step 2 rotates to
`TARGET_HEADING`, holds it within `TOL` for `HOLD_TIME`, then lands.

## You're done when

- Step 1 prints a yaw value in degrees.
- Step 2 rotates to about `TARGET_HEADING` and reports it is holding, without spinning the long way around.

## If it doesn't work

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Spins the long way to the target | Your error isn't wrapped — use `((target - current + 180) % 360) - 180`. |
| Spins continuously, never settles | The yaw command sign is inverted; negate it. |
| Oscillates around the target | Lower `KP_YAW`, or add a small derivative term on the heading rate. |
| Never reports holding | `_hold` must accumulate only while `abs(error) < TOL` and reset otherwise. |

## Going further (optional)

- Make `heading_error` a reusable helper and use it anywhere you compare angles.
- Add a derivative term (rate of heading change) to kill the oscillation, turning this into PD heading hold.
- Combine with Module 3's forward controller: hold a heading *while* flying forward a set distance, so the drone tracks a straight line over the ground.
