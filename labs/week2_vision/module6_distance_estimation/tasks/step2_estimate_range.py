Week 2 · Module 6 — Step 2: Estimate Range and Approach
Turn the gate's apparent width into a distance using the pinhole camera model
(Module 1), then fly forward until you are STOP_DIST meters away.

    distance = FOCAL_PX * REAL_GATE_WIDTH / pixel_width

This is the inverse of the projection you wrote in Module 1: a known real width
projects to a pixel width that shrinks with distance, so distance is recoverable.

    # stop once distance <= STOP_DIST.

    #
    # No gate -> spin at SEARCH_YAW to find one. With a gate, distance =
    # FOCAL_PX * REAL_GATE_WIDTH / w. Yaw to keep its box centered on COL_CENTER and
    # add APPROACH_PITCH forward. Stop and finish once distance <= STOP_DIST.
